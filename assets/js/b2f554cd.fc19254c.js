It works\\neverywhere, suprisingly even on my linux desktop thanks to its progressive web\\napp version. But sharing them can be a pain, a simple website would be better.\\n\\n## Docusaurus\\n\\nI\'ve been using docusaurus at `$DAYJOB` and it\'s pretty so-so as documentation\\ntooling goes. For example, the native search options are uninspiring; either use\\nAlgolia\'s service (not suitable in my case) or use one of the plugins that\\nintegrates [lunr](https://lunrjs.com). I ended up making my own integration with\\nanother search service and Docusaurus made it easy to \\"swizzle\\" the SearchBar.\\n\\nDocusarus\'s most useful feature is as a low-friction way to publish small React\\ncomponents. The sweet spot is where you need a splash of interactivity over\\nmostly static data. E.g. a mini-YouTube for sharing a bunch of videos i recorded\\nor a UI that lets a visitor keep track of and resume their progress through\\nmilestones in a larger HowTo Guide that they might not consume in one visit.\\n\\nThe docusaurus API has annoyingly changed a few times with version bumps. For\\nexample the way to access parts of react-router changed.\\n\\n## This Site\\n\\nAnd so this site exists as a playground for Docusaurus and as a place to\\npublicly share my notes. This post exists only because i want to test-drive\\nthe blog feature which i\'ve never had a use case for before."}]}')}}]);
