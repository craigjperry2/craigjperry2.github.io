Hey, I'm Craig and my passions are DevOps, electronics & just about
anything that runs on petrol! I live outside Glasgow, Scotland with
my wife & son. I'm an easy-going, friendly kinda guy so feel free to
say hello wherever you bump into me; I enjoy a blether about tech.

# DevOps

I've been walking that line between "Dev" and tech "Ops" since before the
phrase "DevOps" was coined. I'm best known for my knowledge of Linux,
Python, Spring (Java) and of course, DevOps.

# Things I've Done

To give a quick flavour of what makes me "tick":

1. I scored in the top few percent on my Redhat Certified Engineer exam. The
   average result on that exam is a fail but i got just shy of 100%
2. I've lead development of major production systems at 3 global banks. The
   most interesting to me was a globally replicated filesystem i created
   which had (almost) full POSIX compliance
3. I've contributed to various open source projects over the years. My most
   popular project has hundreds of thousands of downloads according to PyPI
4. I "clean room" reverse engineered the FlySky wireless telemetry protocol
   and contributed an open source implementation to the most popular flight
   control software project. I've also reversed & patched a binary blob
   (firmware) for a popular closed source RF video transmitter
5. More recently i've been fortunate enough to focus my working hours on
   DevOps, mostly by helping various teams grow their DevOps capabilities
